At Jiuli Street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . Then , three people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk four cases of beer at the time ) . As a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . He bled profusely and lost consciousness . By the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . However , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . As there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life @-@ saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots .

My own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . I am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( Observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) Note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?

That makes the decision to go with IEDs a no @-@ brainer for the insurgents . In the standard ambush , the kind we were facing a year ago , the insurgents detonated an IED under a convoy , then opened up on the stalled survivors with RPG and small arms fire . It probably made them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces , the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power .

So if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal is to find a way to kill M1s . Not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . And that 's where the shaped @-@ charge IED comes in . Shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in MBT anti @-@ armor rounds and antitank weapons . Their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . Metals with low melting points , usually copper . The bomb @-@ maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . So sometimes he 'll put several 155 mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of TNT under it .

Often enough you hear people saying that everyone should contribute towards people going to university because of the economic benefits brought to the whole country by having a better educated population - similarly I may argue that if I had a house it would benefit my neighbours if I had it improved ( maybe repainted , something added to it , a professional garderner or something ) as it would help to improve the neighbourhood and could even improve the value of neighbouring houses , but it would be ridiculous to suggest that my neighbours should therefore contribute to my costs in doing this .

Most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they first get to uni @- you 're definitely not alone there . But I would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . It does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support @- labels are n't as important as your experiences . Meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . But yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere @- but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . Being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse @- be kind to yourself and get some help .
